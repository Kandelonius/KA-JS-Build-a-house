# KA-JS-Build-a-house
Khan Academy project
Project criteria:
Think about your house, or your school building, or your work office. There's a lot of repeating elements - especially
on the outside. In this project, you'll use loops to add repeating elements to this house:

Draw a window, then use a for loop to draw a row of windows (or, use nested for loops to make multiple rows of windows).
Draw a row of grass in front. And maybe some bushes or flowers?
The house is a plain color now. Use loops to make it a brick house or a house with "siding" or a log cabin. Check the 
images library for ways to make that more realistic.
Use a conditional inside a for loop to make more interesting grass or walls, so that you use a different color every 
other execution of the loop (hint: use the % operator).
